## Quick Intro

I am a graduate student specializing in Machine Learning and Trustworthy AI.

At CISPA's [SprintML Lab](https://sprintml.com/team/), I contribute to research on Trustworthy Machine Learning, focusing on frameworks, baseline solutions, and test pipelines for the AI European Championship.

I previously earned my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence (CGPA 3.95/4.0) at NMIMS University, India, where I gained experience in deep learning, recommendation systems, and multimodal biometrics.
