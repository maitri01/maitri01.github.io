## Quick Intro

I am a graduate student specializing in Machine Learning and Trustworthy AI.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant (HiWi) in the SprintML Lab at CISPA, where I contribute to research on Trustworthy Machine Learning. My current focus is on developing the technical framework, baseline solutions, and test pipelines for the AI European Championship.

Previously, during my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence at NMIMS University (Mumbai, India), I worked on multiple projects ranging from efficient computation methods to deep learning for decision-making, recommendation systems, and biometric identification.
