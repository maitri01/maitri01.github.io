### QuadTransport — Optimizing Wasserstein Distance
Worked on efficient computation of the <strong>Wasserstein distance</strong> for large-scale transport problems.

- Implemented optimized algorithms to remove bottlenecks
- Reduced execution time from hours (naive) to seconds
- Built in <strong>Java</strong> with careful profiling and tuning
- Focused on <strong>optimization</strong>, <strong>algorithms</strong>, and <strong>computational efficiency</strong>

### Trust and Tag Aware Recommendation System
Combined <strong>trust networks</strong> and <strong>tag metadata</strong> to improve music recommendations.

- Used the <strong>Last.fm</strong> dataset for social trust and tagging signals
- Applied <strong>Sparse Autoencoders</strong> to encode high-dimensional data
- Addressed <strong>data sparsity</strong> common in collaborative filtering
- Implemented in <strong>Python</strong> (TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas)

### Intraday Trading Signals Classification (LSTM)
Built a deep learning–based trading signal classifier for short-term decisions.

- Designed and trained an <strong>LSTM</strong> model in <strong>TensorFlow</strong>
- Used technical indicators: <strong>SMA</strong>, <strong>RSI</strong>, <strong>MACD</strong>
- Explored backtesting and performance analysis

### Biometric Identification System (Multimodal)
Created a recognition system combining visual and auditory features.

- Built a neural model for <strong>RGB + Thermal</strong> face images and <strong>voice</strong>
- Extracted visual features with <strong>LTP</strong>; processed audio with <strong>MFCC</strong>
- Demonstrated the value of <strong>multimodal fusion</strong>
