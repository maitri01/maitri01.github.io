# Projects  

### QuadTransport â€” Optimizing Wasserstein Distance  
I worked on **efficient computation of the Wasserstein distance** for large-scale transport problems.  
- Implemented an optimized version of the Hungarian Algorithm *(O(iNÂ² log N))* to reduce computational bottlenecks.  
- Reduced execution time from **~5 hours (naÃ¯ve approach)** to **~12 seconds**, enabling real-time computations.  
- Developed in **Java** using **IntelliJ IDEA** with performance profiling and algorithmic tuning.  
- This project strengthened my expertise in **optimization, algorithms, and large-scale computational efficiency**.

### Trust and Tag Aware Recommendation System  
Built a recommendation system by combining **trust networks** and **tag metadata** to improve music recommendations.  
- Used the **Last.fm dataset** to integrate both social trust relations and tagging behavior.  
- Applied **Sparse Auto-Encoders** to encode high-dimensional trust/tag data, improving recommendation accuracy while reducing sparsity.  
- Designed to handle **data sparsity problems**, common in collaborative filtering approaches.  
- Implemented in **Python (TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas)**.

### Intraday Trading Signals Classification (LSTM)  
Developed a **deep learning-based trading signal classifier** for short-term financial decision-making.  
- Designed and trained an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model** in **TensorFlow** to capture temporal dependencies in trading signals.  
- Incorporated technical indicators such as **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**, **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**, and **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** as input features.  
- Model achieved an **average ROI of 20%** across multiple backtesting scenarios.  
- Learned to combine **quantitative finance principles with deep learning architectures**.

### Biometric Identification System (Multimodal)  
Created a **biometric recognition system** combining visual and auditory features.  
- Built a **neural network model** using multimodal data: **RGB + Thermal face images** and **voice signals**.  
- Extracted visual features using **Local Ternary Patterns (LTP)** for face data.  
- Processed voice inputs using **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** for robust speech representation.  
- Achieved higher identification accuracy compared to unimodal models.  
- Demonstrated the potential of **multimodal fusion** for secure biometric systems.
