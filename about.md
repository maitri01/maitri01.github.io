# About Me

Hello, I’m **Maitri Vignesh Shah**.

I am currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence** at *Universität des Saarlandes* and working as a **Research Assistant (HiWi) in the SprintML Lab at CISPA**. My work focuses on **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, where I help design the **technical frameworks, baseline models, and evaluation pipelines** for the *AI European Championship*. It’s an exciting space — part engineering, part research — and it keeps me at the edge of what’s possible with AI.

Before moving to Germany, I completed my **B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence at NMIMS University, Mumbai**, graduating with a **CGPA of 3.95/4.0 (top 1% of my class)**. During those four years, I had the chance to explore different branches of AI — from building LSTM-based trading systems that delivered a measurable ROI, to designing multimodal biometric models that could combine face and voice for identification. Each project gave me something new: how to think rigorously, how to collaborate across teams, and how to move from an idea to a working solution.

### Academic Foundation

Some of the courses that shaped my academic journey and connect directly to my projects include:

* **Trustworthy Machine Learning**
* **Lectures on Modern Optimization Methods**
* **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
* **Computer Vision**
* **Recommendation Systems**
* **Biometrics**

These courses taught me not just algorithms, but also the importance of **reliability, fairness, and scalability** in AI systems.

### Beyond the Classroom

Outside of my coursework, I enjoy **mentoring and collaborating**. I’ve guided student teams as a **Machine Learning Mentor with ACM**, helping them navigate the messy but rewarding process of data analysis, model building, and iteration. I also enjoy exploring creative outlets — painting, photography, and travel — because I believe that curiosity in art and life often sparks better ideas in research.

### Looking Ahead

I see myself growing at the intersection of **research and application**: building AI systems that are not only intelligent but also **trustworthy, efficient, and impactful**. Whether in academia, industry, or collaborative innovation, my goal is to contribute to solutions that genuinely make a difference.
